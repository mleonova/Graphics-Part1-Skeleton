# Animation Project: Skeleton

> This computer animation project consists of three parts:
> [Part1: Skeleton](https://github.com/mleonova/Graphics-Part1-Skeleton)
> [Part 2: Skinning](https://github.com/mleonova/Graphics-Part2-Skinning)
> [Part 3: Animation](https://github.com/mleonova/Graphics-Part3-Animation)


The main objectives of this part are:

1. Loading and parsing a text file (.skel) that describes the skeleton of an object.
2. Posing and displaying the skeleton.

## Background
In computer animation, a skeleton, also known as a rig, is a hierarchical structure of bones or joints that is used to control the movement of characters or objects. It serves as a virtual framework upon which the model or mesh is built, allowing animators to manipulate and animate the character more easily.

A skeleton is organized in a hierarchical manner, resembling the structure of a human skeleton. It consists of a root bone (typically located at the character's hip or base) and a series of interconnected bones that extend outwards, forming a tree-like structure. Each bone is connected to its parent bone, except for the root bone, which is at the top of the hierarchy.

If we're to create skeleton file of Olaf, the aproximate hierarchy would look following:
