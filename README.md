# Animation Project: Skeleton

This is the first part of the computer animation project, followed by two additional parts: [Skinning](https://github.com/mleonova/Animation-Skeleton) and [Animation](https://github.com/mleonova/Graphics-Part3-Animation). 

The main purpose of this part is:
1. Load and parse a text file (.skel) which describes a skeleton. 
2. Pose and display the skeleton

## Background
In computer animation, a skeleton, also known as a rig, is a hierarchical structure of bones or joints that is used to control the movement of characters or objects. It serves as a virtual framework upon which the model or mesh is built, allowing animators to manipulate and animate the character more easily.

A skeleton is organized in a hierarchical manner, resembling the structure of a human skeleton. It consists of a root bone (typically located at the character's hip or base) and a series of interconnected bones that extend outwards, forming a tree-like structure. Each bone is connected to its parent bone, except for the root bone, which is at the top of the hierarchy.
